# Python-Simple-Neural-Network
Its a python neural network component for testing and learning, it has some activation functions and Mean Squared Error loss function!

Its very easy to use, (no external library needed, not even numpy, just the build in 'math' and 'random') just copy the NeuralNetwork.py and Neuron.py into your directory and then use it however you like it! (See test.py for more details and examples)
It does not support paralelisation of any type right now!

It supports Python 3.x
